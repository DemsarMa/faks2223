# ULFE Programming

This repository contains the code of the whole course of programming on Faculty of Electrical engineering in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

The code was written directly from lectures by [prof. Iztok Fajfar](https://fe.uni-lj.si/imenik-zaposlenih/iztok-fajfar/).

## Donating

The repository was entirely made for me to better understand JS and C language. If this helped you, you can buy me a coffee. Thank you!
